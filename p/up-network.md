- free tier: The vendor's page prices VPS Basic Intel S at CHF 2.78 a month in its configuration data (CHF 33.33 billed annually), the same price the tracker's cheapest row carries for the same shape (2 shared vCPU, 4 GB of RAM, a 20 GB disk, IPv6, Gland, Switzerland). The vendor's documentation lists BASIC Intel S as '2 partages / 4 Go ECC / 20 Go / 100 Mb/s' guaranteed with burst to 10 Gb/s, and describes the Intel disk as SSD on a SAN accelerated by an NVMe cache, so the tracker's 'NVMe' label is imprecise. The pricing page's entry line is 'Dès CHF 2.50/mois, paiement annuel'. Locations are Gland in the canton of Vaud, with interconnection at Zurich. | unit: GiB | metered on: wall-clock | read on: 2026-10-22 | source: [1] | note: none

- egress: the vendor states unlimited traffic subject to a fair-use policy it does not quantify on the pages read, at a guaranteed rate of 100 Mb/s on BASIC Intel S with a burst ceiling of 10 Gb/s; the tracker instead lists 50,000 GB/month; no per-TB price is published | metered: no | free allowance: unlimited per the vendor, subject to fair use, at 100 Mb/s guaranteed and 10 Gb/s burst; the tracker lists 50,000 GB a month | source: [1]
- identity: email | detail: not stated
- interface: rest
- limits:
  - per-ip-shaping (binding): The vendor states no monthly byte allowance: it says 'Trafic illimite' and its documentation adds that unlimited traffic 'reste soumis au fair use'. The tracker instead prints 50,000 GB/month, a figure no vendor page read repeats, so it is recorded here as the tracker's and not as the plan's. The real published wall is the rate, 100 Mb/s guaranteed on BASIC Intel S with a burst to 10 Gb/s, so a sustained transfer is shaped rather than cut off. A second gate is IPv4: the vendor documents IPv4 as an option on every BASIC plan, with a /64 IPv6 included by default. [1]
- limits note: The vendor states no monthly byte allowance: it says 'Trafic illimite' and its documentation adds that unlimited traffic 'reste soumis au fair use'. The tracker instead prints 50,000 GB/month, a figure no vendor page read repeats, so it is recorded here as the tracker's and not as the plan's. The real published wall is the rate, 100 Mb/s guaranteed on BASIC Intel S with a burst to 10 Gb/s, so a sustained transfer is shaped rather than cut off. A second gate is IPv4: the vendor documents IPv4 as an option on every BASIC plan, with a /64 IPv6 included by default.
- binding note: the same as limits note
- interface detail: inferred from the tooling the provider documents; not probed
- tooling: the vendor names VMmanager 6, Proxmox VE and KVM as its platforms and offers a BGP session as a plan option; no API was read
- composes with: A Swiss location and an independent AS213929 at the lowest price among the providers compared, with unlimited traffic that is shaped rather than metered. That combination suits a small always-on node whose location matters more than its throughput, and the 20 GB disk keeps it a control point rather than a store.
- reliability: no reliability event observed; the vendor states BASIC and PRO carry no stated availability percentage, best effort only
- notes: Every quote in the first read came from French pages and is reproduced with accents stripped for ASCII. The vendor page's configuration data, read 2026-11-07, prices VPS Basic Intel S at CHF 2.78 a month (CHF 33.33 billed annually) and prices VPS Basic Intel Micro only annually, at CHF 13.33 a year, so the tracker's CHF 2.78 row and the vendor's own price agree; the pricing page's entry line still reads 'Dès CHF 2.50/mois, paiement annuel', which matches no SKU's monthly price in the page's data. IPv4 is an add-on on Basic Intel S (none included, the add-on priced CHF 3.33 a month on the monthly period) where the PRO plans include one. The documentation lists the BASIC Intel Micro at 1 shared vCPU, 512 Mo and 10 Go with a 50 Mb/s guaranteed rate. The tracker's 10 Gbps port is the burst ceiling, not the guaranteed rate, and is recorded as such here. Wall: a raw fetch of up-network.ch failed on the first read (nothing established about the target) and the text reader returned the page; the read of 2026-11-07 is a registered raw fetch of the same page.
