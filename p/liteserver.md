- per-object cap: not applicable | source: [1]
- retention: not applicable | source: [1]
- egress: 15 TB a month included, then the port is limited to 10 Mbps for the rest of the calendar month instead of the machine being suspended; extra bandwidth sold at EUR 2.50 per 5 TB block | metered: yes | free allowance: 15360 | price per TB: EUR 2.50 per 5 TB block, so EUR 0.50 per TB | source: [1]
- identity: email | detail: not stated
- interface: rest
- limits:
  - volume-quota (binding): 15 TB a month; on exhaustion the vendor throttles the port to 10 Mbps for the rest of the calendar month rather than suspending, and extra bandwidth is EUR 2.50 per 5 TB block. The 512 GB HDD and the single core are the other limits [1]
- limits note: 15 TB a month; on exhaustion the vendor throttles the port to 10 Mbps for the rest of the calendar month rather than suspending, and extra bandwidth is EUR 2.50 per 5 TB block. The 512 GB HDD and the single core are the other limits
- binding note: the same as limits note
- interface detail: inferred from the tooling the provider documents; not probed
- tooling: WHMCS cart at clients.liteserver.nl with per-plan add-ons for cores, RAM, HDD blocks and bandwidth blocks; no API is documented on the pages read; KVM with instant setup and a 24 hour manual verification window
- composes with: 512 GB of HDD for EUR 6 is the largest disk on the cheapest plan among evaluated providers, and the throttle-instead-of-suspend policy makes it usable as a mirror target rather than a host that goes dark at the cap; 15 TB a month is about one full replication pass of the 10 TB active dataset, so it is a backup tier rather than a serving tier, and the 20 TB dataset does not fit on one such plan at all.
- reliability: no reliability event recorded
- notes: The vendor and the tracker agree exactly on the HDD-1G shape and price. Disk-per-euro is the reason this record exists: EUR 6 for 512 GB against EUR 4.50 for 30 GB at Luxvps. The 15 TB is the tracker's 15,360 GB and the vendor's '15 TB'.
