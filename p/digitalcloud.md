- free tier: Lite Cloud: USD 7.99 list with printed discounts to USD 5.59 a month (30 percent off), USD 5.99 (25 percent), USD 6.39 (20 percent) and USD 7.59 (5 percent), the deepest on the longest term the table labels, the 36-month plan; the plan is 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 20 GB NVMe, 200 Mbps. Start Cloud: USD 11.99 list with discounts to USD 8.39 a month (30 percent off) on the same structure (2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 40 GB NVMe, 400 Mbps). Standard Cloud: USD 19.99 list, USD 13.99 a month at the deepest discount. Pro Cloud: USD 35.99 list, USD 25.19 at the deepest (4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 160 GB NVMe, 700 Mbps). The order pages' own carts price the four plans at the monthly term, billed monthly: Lite USD 10.40, Start USD 15.60, Standard USD 26.00 and Pro USD 46.80 a month at the location the order links select, above the marketing table's list prices. The carts' billing-period selector offers 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months at 5, 15, 20, 25 and 30 percent off, so the annual price is derived from the cart's own monthly price, not printed.

- limits:
  - per-ip-shaping (binding): The four plan rows state port speeds of 200, 400, 500 and 700 Mbps (Lite, Start, Standard, Pro Cloud); the order configurator's live summary can show a speed no plan row states, for a shape the table does not list, and states traffic as unlimited, so the port is the wall; no byte allowance or fair-use term appears on the pages read. [1]
- limits note: The four plan rows state port speeds of 200, 400, 500 and 700 Mbps (Lite, Start, Standard, Pro Cloud); the order configurator's live summary can show a speed no plan row states, for a shape the table does not list, and states traffic as unlimited, so the port is the wall; no byte allowance or fair-use term appears on the pages read.
- binding note: the same as limits note
- interface detail: inferred from the tooling the provider documents; not probed
- tooling: API access claimed in the meta description ('IPv4/IPv6, and API access'); no endpoint documented on the page read
- composes with: USD 3.99 for 2 GB and 25 GB of NVMe with eleven locations is the widest cheap European and Asian footprint in the Chinese lane, and the 40 percent term discount is repeatable if the term is right
- reliability: no reliability event recorded
- notes: Source: zhujiceping offer listing ('digitalcloud VPS $3.99/ '), then the vendor page. The vendor disagrees with itself on the floor: the meta description says USD 5.85 while the promo row says USD 3.99 and the configurator says USD 5.85 for a different shape. The company is stated on the review site as HLISTAN ZOLERANI, UNIPESSOAL LDA, a Portuguese entity with tax number 517417901, which is not checked against a registry here.
