## Tothost

- `compute/tothost` | trial-only | evidence documented | binding per-ip-shaping | category cloud VM

- free tier: Cloud VPS TOT K from VND 67,500/month on the vendor's home page (the page's 'chi tu 67.500 VND/thang' entry for the TOT K line). The plan shapes are the tracker's: USD 3.00/month for 1 Intel core, 512 MB RAM, 8 GB SSD, 31,641 GB/month bandwidth on a 0.1 Gbps port; the vendor's TOT K line is sold in Ha Noi (VNPT or CMC) or Ho Chi Minh City (FPT), and the tracker's row is Ho Chi Minh. The TOT K plan table did not render to text, so the specs at VND 67,500 are not first-party here. | unit: GiB | metered on: wall-clock | read on: 2026-10-22 | source: [1] | note: trial
- per-object cap: not applicable | source: [1]
- retention: not applicable | source: [1]
- egress: unlimited data transfer stated on the TOT K page; the tracker's 31,641 GB a month is not on the vendor page and matches the 100 Mb/s line rate over 30 days, so the port is the real limit | metered: no | source: [2]
- identity: email | detail: email: an account is created in the order flow with a working email address that must be verified ('Hãy sử dụng email đang hoạt động để đăng ký tài khoản', 'bạn nhớ vào kiểm tra và xác thực email nhé'). Card: not published: https://tothost.vn/chinh-sach-thanh-toan (2026-11-06) names payment gateways and states no card requirement at sign-up. Phone: not published: https://tothost.vn/huong-dan-su-dung/cach-dang-ky-tai-khoan-tothost (2026-11-06) states no phone requirement. Country: not published: the sign-up guide states no country restriction.
- interface: rest
- limits:
  - per-ip-shaping (binding): the vendor's TOT K page states unlimited data transfer (translated from the Vietnamese page text), so the wall is the 100 Mb/s port; the tracker's 31,641 GB a month is arithmetically the line rate of a 100 Mb/s port over 30 days, which suggests a derived figure rather than a published allowance [1]
- limits note: the vendor's TOT K page states unlimited data transfer (translated from the Vietnamese page text), so the wall is the 100 Mb/s port; the tracker's 31,641 GB a month is arithmetically the line rate of a 100 Mb/s port over 30 days, which suggests a derived figure rather than a published allowance
- binding note: the same as limits note
- interface detail: inferred from the tooling the provider documents; not probed
- tooling: the vendor sells VDC instances and a client portal at billing.tothost.vn with a looking glass at lg.tothost.vn; no API is documented on the page read
- composes with: a 100 Mb/s port caps this at roughly 1 TB a day at best, so it is a Vietnam-region presence rather than a transfer host; the 8 GB disk and 512 MB rule out anything but a probe, a proxy or a small scheduler
- reliability: no reliability event recorded
- notes: The trial is the reason this record is not paid-only: the TOT K page carries a free-trial registration form, but the page states no duration, no configuration and no terms, so the trial is a claim to test rather than a quota to rely on. The vendor and the tracker quote different currencies for the same line, and no conversion was done. The vendor offers Ha Noi or Ho Chi Minh City for the same line, so the location in the offer is the tracker's row and not the only option. Unverified: the plan table behind the JS widget, which would give the specs at VND 67,500 first-party, and the trial terms. Rendering and provenance: currency symbols are written out (EUR, GBP, RUB, VND), diacritics in place names are folded to ASCII, and a price the page splits across two lines is joined as value/period; the tracker page stated 'Database update: 7 hours ago' when it was read on 2026-10-22.
