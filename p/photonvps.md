## PhotonVPS

- `compute/photonvps` | paid-only | evidence documented | binding volume-quota | category cloud VM
- identity a placeholder: card and phone unknown | verified 2026-11-07T14:16:58.954Z (live) | stale on 2026-12-08
- url https://www.photonvps.com/linux.html
- price parsed USD 5/mo
- free tier: NVMe - X at USD 5.00/month: 1 CPU core, 2048 MB RAM, 30 GB NVMe, 2000 GB/month bandwidth, 100 Mbps, IPv4 plus IPv6. The billing portal's Tokyo store lists it as 'Tokyo Linux NVMe Cloud X Starting from $5.00 USD Monthly Order Now' - monthly term, in stock; annual and renewal prices are not published, and the portal's product detail pages redirect to a fallback category, so no per-cycle price is reachable. The plan table publishes one order button per location: London, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Moscow, Johannesburg, Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Taiwan, Tokyo, Seoul, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Ashburn, Sao Paulo. The next step up, NVMe - 1, is USD 10.00 with 1 core, 4096 MB and 60 GB at 250 Mbps. | unit: GiB | metered on: wall-clock | read on: 2026-10-22 | source: [1] | note: none
- per-object cap: not applicable | source: [1]
- retention: not applicable | source: [1]
- egress: bandwidth is stated per plan and per location: 2000 GB a month on the X plan in most locations, 100 GB on the Taiwan row as listed by the tracker; no overage price was published on the page read | metered: yes | free allowance: 2000 GB/month on the X plan; 100 GB/month on Taiwan per the tracker | source: [1]
- identity: email | detail: not stated
- interface: rest
- limits:
  - volume-quota (binding): 2000 GB a month on the X plan at 100 Mbps. The allowance is per location and not uniform: the tracker's Taiwan row for the same X plan states 100 GB/month, twenty times smaller, so a Taiwan box would exhaust its allowance in about three days of continuous 100 Mbps traffic by arithmetic. [1]
- limits note: 2000 GB a month on the X plan at 100 Mbps. The allowance is per location and not uniform: the tracker's Taiwan row for the same X plan states 100 GB/month, twenty times smaller, so a Taiwan box would exhaust its allowance in about three days of continuous 100 Mbps traffic by arithmetic.
- binding note: the same as limits note
- interface detail: inferred from the tooling the provider documents; not probed
- tooling: WHMCS billing portal at photonvps.com/billing with a client area, registration and knowledgebase; no API was stated on the pages read
- composes with: USD 5.00 for 2 GB and 30 GB of NVMe in Tokyo, Seoul or Singapore is the cheapest APAC capacity among documented hosts and the only one with a 2 GB entry plan. The 100 Mbps port and the 2 TB cap make it a crawler worker rather than a serving host, and it is this category's best option for a source that only answers from an Asian IP.
- reliability: the vendor advertises DDoS protection and a 30-day money-back guarantee on the homepage; no uptime SLA figure was read, and no reliability incident observed
- notes: or docs/ (searched both trees for photonvps, no hit). The plan table is driven by a location selector and lists three network values per row (100, '100 Mbps', '10 Gbps'), so which figure applies to which location is not resolvable from the extracted table; the 100 Mbps reading is the one in the Network column. Los Angeles orders are redirected to the parent, Psychz Networks. Unverified: the port speed and allowance per location, and whether the X plan really is 30 GB of NVMe in Moscow where the selector says SSD.
