- free tier: USD 5.99 per month for AX-v1 in Frankfurt: 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 10 GB NVMe SSD, unmetered traffic on a port of up to 2 Gbps shared, 1 IPv4, KVM, as the vendor page now renders. The ladder above it: USD 6.99 (AX-v2), USD 9.99 (AX-v3), USD 13.99 (AX-v4), USD 17.99 (AX-v5), USD 24.99 (AX-v6), USD 34.99 (AX-v7), USD 49.99 (AX-v8), USD 64.99 (AX-v9), USD 89.99 (AX-v10), USD 119.99 (AX-v11) and USD 169.99 (AX-v12), all Frankfurt; the page also names Amsterdam, Montreal and Detroit, each marked 'Available'. Every plan's term selector prints 1 month as the default with 3 months at 5 percent off, 6 months at 10 percent off and 12 months at 15 percent off; the discounted totals are computed in the page, so the annual price is derived, not printed. The per-term absolute prices behind the order system stay unverified: the BILLmanager order system at hub.axion.host renders its registration and order forms client-side, and its register page answers a JavaScript shell to a fetch. Renewal price: not published on any page read. No sold-out marker on the vendor page. | unit: GiB | metered on: wall-clock | read on: 2026-10-23 | source: [1] | note: none
