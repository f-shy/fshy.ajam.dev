- free tier: No free credit. Quoted: 'Create an account and deposit funds'; the quickstart puts the floor at 'minimum ~USD 5 to start'. Rental kinds quoted: On-Demand 'Guaranteed access - no one can interrupt your rental - Fee: 10% (5% with PoH)'; Spot 'Lower cost - but can be outbid by others - Fee: 2.5%'. | unit: none | metered on: wall-clock | read on: 2026-10-22 | source: [1] | note: kind not stated
- per-object cap: not applicable | source: [1]
- retention: not applicable | source: [1]
- egress: not stated | metered: no | source: [1]
- identity: email | detail: No KYC for basic use: the FAQ states "Basic usage does not require KYC. However, for large withdrawals or compliance-related cases, the platform may request identity verification", and funding is crypto only. "Add funds via CLORE, BTC, USDT, or USDC (minimum ~USD 5 to start)". So no card rail exists and the card questions do not arise; the USD 5 is a minimum deposit, not an authorisation hold. The record does not state what identifier account creation asks for.
- interface: unknown
- limits:
  - volume-quota (binding): The roughly USD 5 deposit fails first, and payment rails are CLORE, BTC, USDT or USDC, so a card-only client has no path in. [1]
- limits note: The roughly USD 5 deposit fails first, and payment rails are CLORE, BTC, USDT or USDC, so a card-only client has no path in.
- binding note: the same as limits note
- interface detail: inferred from the tooling the provider documents; not probed
- tooling: not stated
- composes with: None at zero budget. The 10 percent on-demand fee is the highest platform fee found in this class and it makes Clore the wrong default even once a budget exists.
- reliability: no reliability event recorded
- notes: A contrast case: Clore shows the standard split this class uses: an on-demand tier where interruption is excluded and a spot tier where it is not, with the fee moving from 10 percent to 2.5 percent to price the difference. That is the same trade Lium makes with Secure and Spot, and the same one Vast makes with on-demand and interruptible. The class is consistent on this point and a client should expect it. Per-card rates read on 2026-11-06: the vendor's pricing guide (snapshot 24 August 2026) lists H100 NVL 94GB at about USD 1.04 per GPU-hour, L40S 48GB at about USD 0.50 per GPU-hour and RTX 4090 24GB at USD 0.14 to 0.42 (median USD 0.20), and states that A100, H200 and B200 are not listed on the marketplace; it prices no L4. The live marketplace feed the same day returns, as the lowest per-GPU-hour listing available for each card, a 2x H100 NVL at USD 45 per day (USD 0.94 per GPU-hour), a 1x A100 80GB PCIe at USD 11 per day (USD 0.46 per GPU-hour), a 1x L40S at USD 15 per day (USD 0.63 per GPU-hour), a 4x L4 at USD 10 per day (USD 0.10 per GPU-hour) and a 2x RTX 4090 at USD 14.44 per day (USD 0.30 per GPU-hour). Every marketplace price is set by the host, not by Clore.
